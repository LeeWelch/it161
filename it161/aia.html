        <td><span class="groups">Holiday Customers:</span>
        Their age group is 20+, all genders, they have jobs that allow them to take off for the holidays, and they have all education levels. Violette Morganti only offers services within a 1-mile radius of downtown Seattle, so their clients generally reside in central Seattle. The income for this customer group reflects the average Seattle income of $52,000 per year for individuals. They have good internet access, like most people in downtown Seattle, and they may use any browser or platform. They are likely to have moderate to excellent computer skills and experience.

        <td>
         <ul>
            <li>These customers may not book pet sitters outside of the holidays, so they’re unfamiliar with the process and may be nervous and/or overwhelmed. </li>
            <li>They’re anxious about leaving their pet with a pet sitter, and need to find someone they can trust. They want good communication with frequent check ins and updates during their pet’s stay. </li>

        <td><span class="groups">Senior Customers:</span>
          Their age group is 65+; they are usually retired and don’t work, but they may work part-time or volunteer. This group can be any gender; their income comes from their retirement fund; and they have all levels of education. Their computer skills and abilities will usually be low to moderate; they’ll use the platform they have the most experience with, often Windows. They’ll use the default browser on their device, often Microsoft Edge, and they don’t need high-speed internet for work, so they may just have sufficient speed for streaming services and social media. They favor tablets, desktops, and their phones over laptops and may not have high-resolution monitors on their devices.

          <ul>
